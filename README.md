# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile!
I'm an iOS Developer with a hunger and drive to fully understand Apple's software. I enjoy iOS development because I'm a fan of Apple and appreciate their level of engineering. I also agree that privacy is a fundamental human right, which compels me to always put the user first. Despite the complexity of learning how to build World-Class iOS Applications, it doesn't seem any less interesting from when I first started. My ultimate goal is to grab this world by the roots and redesign the status quo. Mostly through the use of code.
