# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile!
Hi! I'm an Aspiring iOS Developer and Finance/Fintech Student at the University Of Miami. Iâ€™m a huge fan of the swift programming language, which is why Iâ€™m interested in building as many apps for Apple as I can. I also have a passing interest in blockchain and crypto, with my favorite one being Solana. Iâ€™m looking forward to the next generation of the internet, where I plan to combine my knowledge of business, technology, and crypto. My ultimate goal is to program a better world. In other words, to use code for good.
